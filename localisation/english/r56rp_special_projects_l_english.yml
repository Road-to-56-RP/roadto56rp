  sp_r56rp_naval_panzerschiff: "Pocket Battleship"
  sp_r56rp_naval_panzerschiff_desc: "The ability to project naval power on the world stage, be it for offensive actions or to protect our trade, is critical in the modern day. Several of our engineers having seen designs coming out of Germany believe that by specializing a cruiser hull in a style similar to the ''Pocket Battleship,'' we might be able to acheve long range operation with respectable firepower."

  sp_r56rp_naval_coastal_ships: "Coastal Defence Ship"
  sp_r56rp_naval_coastal_ships_desc: "Several members of the armed forces feel that our coastal waters are too lightly defended, as such they have put forward several concepts all falling under similar parameters. built off existing light cruisers, the ship would be up gunned to pose a threat to ships from the 20's and 30's, favoring a low cost of construction over blue water operations."

  sp_r56rp_naval_super_sub: "Project A.L.I.C.O.R.N."
  sp_r56rp_naval_super_sub_desc: "With the sucsess of our submersible deck guns, submarines, and understanding of sea surviced aircraft on carriers. Several of our more unhinged Scientists have put forward a frankly insane design. Dubbed the ''Advanced Long-range Integrated Combat Operations Reconnaissance Nautical'' project, The ship looks to make a large, well armed, submersible warship. designs have gone so far as to propose mounting a facility to operate rocket powered projectiles. This project is ambitious to perhaps a fault, with the bulk of our researchers outlining issues given existing technology, however if the program comes into being. we could have a proper warships worth of firepower at our disposal"

## AIR SPECIAL PROJECTS

  sp_r56rp_air_revolving_cannon: "Revolver Cannon"
  sp_r56rp_air_revolving_cannon_desc: "With airplanes getting faster and faster, our weaponry must keep up. Window of opportunity to score hits on the enemy planes now measure in tenths of a second, and old weaponry cannot keep up. By using multiple chambers to load a single barrel we can drastically increase the firerate of our cannons."

  sp_r56rp_air_afterburning_jet_engine: "Reheating Jet Engines"
  sp_r56rp_air_afterburning_jet_engine_desc: "By dumping fuel into the superheated engine exhaust, we can increase the engine thrust, for a minimal weight and cost increase. This method is unfortunately terribly inefficient increasing combat fuel use dramatically."

  sp_r56rp_automatic_gun_laying_turret: "Automatic Gun-Laying Turret"
  sp_r56rp_automatic_gun_laying_turret_desc: "Recent progress in radar technology spawned a proposal from the engineering team. They propose to integrate a compact radar set to an airplane turret. This will allow for an easier detection of hostile targets, especially during night missions and it might potentially allow the turret to autonomously engage targets."
