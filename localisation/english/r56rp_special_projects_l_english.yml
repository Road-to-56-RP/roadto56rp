 sp_r56rp_naval_panzerschiff: "Long Range Cruiser Experiments"
 sp_r56rp_naval_panzerschiff_desc: "The ability to project naval power on the world stage, be it for offensive actions or to protect our trade, is critical in the modern day. Several of our engineers having seen designs coming out of Germany believe that by specializing a cruiser hull in a style similar to the ''Pocket Battleship,'' we might be able to acheve long range operation with respectable firepower."
 sp_r56rp_naval_coastal_ships: "Coastal Defence Program"
 sp_r56rp_naval_coastal_ships_desc: "Several members of the armed forces feel that our coastal waters are too lightly defended, as such they have put forward several concepts all falling under similar parameters. built off existing light cruisers, the ship would be up gunned to pose a threat to ships from the 20's and 30's, favoring a low cost of construction over blue water operations."

 sp_r56rp_naval_super_sub: "Project A.L.I.C.O.R.N."
 sp_r56rp_naval_super_sub_desc: "With the sucsess of our submersible deck guns, submarines, and understanding of sea surviced aircraft on carriers. Several of our more unhinged Scientists have put forward a frankly insane design. Dubbed the ''Advanced Long-range Integrated Combat Operations Reconnaissance Nautical'' project, The ship looks to make a large, well armed, submersible warship. designs have gone so far as to propose mounting a facility to operate rocket powered projectiles. This project is ambitious to perhaps a fault, with the bulk of our researchers outlining issues given existing technology, however if the program comes into being. we could have a proper warships worth of firepower at our disposal"

 sp_r56rp_air_revolving_cannon: "Revolving Cannon"
 sp_r56rp_air_revolving_cannon_desc: "With airplanes getting faster and faster, our weaponry must keep up. Window of opportunity to score hits on the enemy planes now measure in tenths of a second, and old weaponry cannot keep up. By using multiple chambers to load a single barrel we can drastically increase the firerate of our cannons."
