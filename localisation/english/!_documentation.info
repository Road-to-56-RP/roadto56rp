/replace folder is ONLY for overriding specific localisation lines for road and vanilla.
So fixing typo's and singular renames.

Changing loaclisation from road that already exists in road's /replace folder, might require the entire file be overriden 
in the /replace folder. sometimes, not always.

When making locailsation, dont bother doing the :0, just do : so highlights look nicer in MS Code.

When adding new additions, do not add them in vanilla or road files. make a new file. it makes it much easier to upkeep
as you do not have to wonder if a line of text is added by road, vanilla or rp, and you do not have to update the file 
whenever road updates

file naming convention:
r56rp_whatthisisfor_l_english.yml

groups all rp specific files by rp, then by purpouse. easier to navigate.

r56rp_ns_TAG_l_english.yml
r56rp_ns stands for "nation specific", so all things specifically for a singular nation.
