 r56rp_specops_combined_1: "Rigorous Training"
 r56rp_specops_combined_1_desc: "By constantly training and preparing for any scenario, our special troops can engage any targets better."
 r56rp_specops_combined_2: "Brutal Training"
 r56rp_specops_combined_2_desc: "Our enemies will not be kind to our SpecOps. We must prepare them for the brutality of war, even if such treatment might be considered “barbaric” by the civilian population."
 r56rp_specops_combined_3: "Modern Training Methods"
 r56rp_specops_combined_3_desc: "With new training methods emerging, our SpecOps forces will not bend nor break against the enemy onslaught."

 ## Electronics
 r56rp_jet_engines: "Jet Engines"
 r56rp_jet_engines_desc: "This radical new technology abandons the traditional method of pistons operating in repeating cycles and simply continuously performs the combustion steps in specific parts of the engine. This solution is lighter, and thanks to the high air throughput allows to reach astonishing speeds, at the cost of lower take-off thrust."
 r56rp_jet_engines_2_bba: "Advanced Jet Engines"
 r56rp_jet_engines_2_bba_desc: "Metallurgical improvements allow for much more durable turbines and higher combustion temperatures, increasing efficiency and thrust dramatically."
 r56rp_jet_engines_3_bba: "Reheating Jet Engines"
 r56rp_jet_engines_3_bba_desc: "By dumping fuel into the superheated engine exhaust, we can increase the engine thrust, for a minimal weight and cost increase. This method is unfortunately terribly inefficient increasing combat fuel use dramatically."

 r56rp_gyro_gunsights_bba: "Gyroscopic Gunsights"
 r56rp_gyro_gunsights_bba_desc: "A reflective sight, coupled to a simple calculator. After inputting the range and size of an enemy plane, bullet drop and the required lead is calculated automatically and displayed for the pilot."
 r56rp_gyro_gunsights: "$r56rp_gyro_gunsights_bba$"
 r56rp_gyro_gunsights_desc: "$r56rp_gyro_gunsights_bba_desc$"

 r56rp_radar_gunsights_bba: "Radar Gunsights"
 r56rp_radar_gunsights_bba_desc: "While a gyroscopic gunsight itself is not a novel idea, feeding range information to it automatically by an onboard radar is. This will tremendously increase our pilots accuracy as well as allow for use of tracer-less ammo."
 r56rp_radar_gunsights: "$r56rp_radar_gunsights_bba$"
 r56rp_radar_gunsights_desc: "$r56rp_radar_gunsights_bba_desc$"

 r56rp_air_to_air_nukes_bba: "Nuclear Air-to-Air Missiles"
 r56rp_air_to_air_nukes_bba_desc: "With the recent progress in miniaturizing nuclear warheads we can now produce a relatively light air-to-air missile with tremendous firepower. Such a missile is rather expensive but a single one can reliably deal with a large formation of enemy bombers."
 r56rp_air_to_air_nukes: "$r56rp_air_to_air_nukes_bba$"
 r56rp_air_to_air_nukes_desc: "$r56rp_air_to_air_nukes_bba_desc$"

 r56rp_nucular_depth_charge_mtg: "Nuclear Depth Charges"
 r56rp_nucular_depth_charge_mtg_desc: "Anything creating a shockwave under water can be utilized as a depth charge. Nothing can topple the shockwave created by a nuclear device. More expensive compared to conventional explosives however unmatched in it firepower."
 r56rp_nucular_depth_charge: "$r56rp_nucular_depth_charge_mtg$"
 r56rp_nucular_depth_charge_desc: "$r56rp_nucular_depth_charge_mtg_desc$"

 r56rp_modern_rangefinder: "Modern Fire-Control Systems"
 r56rp_modern_rangefinder_desc: "With the increase in computational capacity of mechanical calculators as well as the ever increasing accuracy of rangefinding systems not only can we increase the performance of our shipborne systems but make a miniature FCS system for our tanks as well."

 ## Air Tab
 r56rp_airborne_rocketry: "Airborne Rocketry"
 r56rp_airborne_rocketry_desc: "With rocket motors becoming more reliable and easy to manufacture, we may consider military use for them."
 r56rp_aa_rocket_rails: "Air-to-Air Rockets"
 r56rp_aa_rocket_rails_desc: "Current day enemy Bombers are more and more resilitent to small and medium calibre weapons. To remedy this, we can arm our Fighters with large calibre unguided rockets."
 r56rp_aa_rocket_rails_2: "Air-to-Air Missiles"
 r56rp_aa_rocket_rails_2_desc: "By installing state-of-the-art electronics in our rockets we may guide them to enemy air targets dramatically increasing the chance to hit."

 r56rp_armor_upgrade_1: "Low Density Armor Plating"
 r56rp_armor_upgrade_1_desc: ""

 r56rp_speed_wings: "Transonic Wings"
 r56rp_speed_wings_desc: "Reaching the speed of sound may sound like science fiction and it indeed provides a lot of difficulties. Air at such high speeds heats up aircraft components significantly and the transition from sub- to super-sonic speeds is accompanied by a tremendous shock wave."
 r56rp_wing_flyingwing: "Flying Wing"
 r56rp_wing_flyingwing_desc: "Yet another radical idea. By housing all necessary equipment within the main wing, and moving some avionics, we may completely do away with the fuselage and a dedicated tail, reducing drag and increasing fuel efficiency. Such a design is difficult to pilot due to its novelty."

 r56rp_guided_anti_ship_bomb: "Anti-Ship Glide Bomb"
 r56rp_guided_anti_ship_bomb_desc: "By allowing our Bombers to remotely guide their bombs, we may reach unprecedented levels of accuracy against surface targets. This will aid our Bombers in assaulting naval targets from a safe altitude."

 r56rp_aa_cannon_3: "Revolver Cannon"
 r56rp_aa_cannon_3_desc: "With airplanes getting faster and faster, our weaponry must keep up. Window of opportunity to score hits on the enemy planes now measure in tenths of a second, and old weaponry cannot keep up. By using multiple chambers to load a single barrel we can drastically increase the firerate of our cannons."
 r56rp_aa_hmg_2: "Fast-Firing Heavy Machine Gun"
 r56rp_aa_hmg_2_desc: "While our previous Heavy Machine Guns have proven to be capable of taking down enemy planes, the volume of fire was found insufficient. Increasing the amount of lead we throw down range heightens our chance to hit as well as deals more damage to more resilient and less maneuverable enemy units."
 r56rp_aa_cannon_4: "Schräge Musik"
 r56rp_aa_cannon_4_desc: "By mounting additional upwards-firing cannons in the fuselage, we can safely engage enemy bombers from below."

 ## Tank Tab
 r56rp_armor_tech_6: "Composite Armor"
 r56rp_armor_tech_6_desc: "With the advent of modern chemical munitions, steel is unable to keep up. Our engineers have proposed to use both ceramic and steel in layers. While more expensive, this armor layout provides significantly more protection for the same armor weight compared to pure steel."

 ## Artillery Tab
 r56rp_sam_1: "Surface-to-Air Missiles"
 r56rp_sam_1_desc: "Having an ability to remotely guide our anti-air munition negates some of airplane advantages and ensures a higher kill ratio. Due to its weight, SAM systems are not yet pheasable to deploy for our infantry and vehicles, however ships have no such issue."
