### Air Equipment overrides

l_english:

 aircraft_cannon_1_1x: "1x Drum-Fed Cannon"
 aircraft_cannon_1_1x_desc: "An automatic cannon offers a significant amount of firepower against air targets, but the added weight makes the plane both slower and less maneuverable."
 aircraft_cannon_1_2x: "2x Drum-Fed Cannon"
 aircraft_cannon_1_2x_desc: "Two automatic cannons give a plane a fearsome forward-firing armament against air and soft ground targets, at considerable cost in weight and agility."

 aircraft_cannon_2_1x: "1x Belt-Fed Aircraft Cannon"
 aircraft_cannon_2_1x_desc: "Firing a larger and more powerful shell than previous iterations of autocannons, this weapon can bring down even a large airframe in a single hit."
 aircraft_cannon_2_2x: "2x Belt-Fed Aircraft Cannon"
 aircraft_cannon_2_2x_desc: "Twin cannons give a plane a significant amount of punch, while the increased volume of fire makes scoring crippling hits even easier."
 
 dive_brakes_small: "Dive Brakes"
 dive_brakes_small_desc: "A set of spoilers along the trailing edge of the wing deploy when the plane enters a dive, reducing overall speed and allowing the plane to pull out of steep dives without ripping its wings off. This, in turn, allows the plane to attack from a near-vertical dive, drastically increasing accuracy."

 guided_anti_ship_missile: "Guided Anti-Ship Missile"
 guided_anti_ship_missile_desc: "Effectively an anti-ship bomb with a rocket engine and radio guidance, this new weapon of war is a serious threat to all ships currently afloat."

 early_bombs: "Bombs"
 early_bombs_desc: "Since the early days of the Great War, airplanes have been increasingly used to drop explosives onto enemy targets. Over time, this has developed more and more into a fundamental aspect of aerial warfare."

 photo_reconnaisance: "Photo Reconnaissance"
 photo_reconnaisance_desc: "The first clear military purpose of the aeroplane was to find the enemy and report their location to the Generals on the ground. This still remains one of the most common tasks of military aviation."

 aa_lmg: "Light MG"
 aa_lmg_desc: "Rifle-caliber machine guns have formed the mainstay of air-to-air weaponry since the days of the Great War."
 aa_hmg: "Heavy MG"
 aa_hmg_desc: "Modern planes are capable of withstanding significantly more punishment than older models, while also offering fewer opportunities to score hits. Each hit must therefore do the maximum amount of damage, requiring a bigger cartridge."
 aa_cannon_1: "Drum-Fed Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_1_desc: "A cannon shell can punch through even the toughest airplane, while potentially carrying enough explosives to do crippling damage when it hits."
  aa_cannon_1: "Cannons I"
 aa_cannon_1_desc: "A cannon shell can punch through even the toughest airplane, while potentially carrying enough explosives to do crippling damage when it hits."
 aa_cannon_2: "Large Cannons"
 aa_cannon_2_desc: "With a higher caliber and a bigger shell, these cannons can bring down even large planes in a single hit."
 aa_cannon_3: "Belt-Fed Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_3_desc: "With a higher caliber and a bigger shell, these cannons can bring down even large planes in a single hit."
 engines_1: "Basic Aircraft Propulsion"
 engines_1_desc: "Airplane engines must be powerful, but lightweight and reliable."
 engines_2: "Engines II"
 engines_2_desc: "The rapid growth of airplanes requires a corresponding growth of engine power."
 engines_3: "Engines III"
 engines_3_desc: "$engine_3_1x_desc$"
 engines_4: "Engines IV"
 engines_4_desc: "$engine_4_1x_desc$"

 plane_modules_tech: "Plane Modules"

 AIR_TITLE_AIRFRAME: "Airframes"
 AIR_TITLE_WEAPONS: "Weaponry"
 AIR_TITLE_ENGINES: "Propulsion"

 #AA Rockets
 AA_rocket_rails: "Air-to-Air Rockets"
 AA_rocket_rails_desc: "Unguided Air-to-Air rockets."
 guided_AA_rocket_rails: "Air-to-Air Missiles"
 guided_AA_rocket_rails_desc: "Primitive remote guided air-to-air missiles."
