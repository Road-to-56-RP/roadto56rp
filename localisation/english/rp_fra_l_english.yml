 fra_expanisonism_category_desc:0 "While France's revanchism has waned in the years following the Compiègne armistice, our reach in Europe is faint compared to our days as the Western Europe's chief land power. In due time, perhaps our rightful lands may be retaken, and Paris will once more be the protector of the values on which our nation stands. Vive la France!"
 
 fra_core_wll:0 "Reintegrate Wallonia"
 fra_core_wll_desc:0 "The long-Belgian region of Wallonia has strong cultural and historic connections, and an all-but-total linguistic one to the French Métrope. Despite this, the Belgians possess a strong civic identity, a hostility to foreign interference, and a large German-speaking minority. Fulfilling integration into the French Métrope will take time, but we believe it is possible."

While it has established itself a strong identity, a large plethora of its population is French-speaking. Fulfilling integration into the French Métrope will take time, but we believe it is possible."

While the Swiss have established themselves a strong identity, and several ethnic minorities lives in the surrounding area, we believe eventual integration is possible."

 fra_core_cataluna:0 "Grants the Catalans Autonomy"
 fra_core_cataluna_desc:0 "While Catalonia was never an integral part of the French Empire, it was an important holding. Moreover, Catalans, many times throughout history, have looked toward the French for protection. We can use this fact to integrate Catalonia with a level of autonomy the Spanish failed to provide."

 fra_push_germany_east_desc:0 "One of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles was the demilitarization of the German region known as the Rhineland, which has been violated by the government in Berlin.
