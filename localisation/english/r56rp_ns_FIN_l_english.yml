 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.1.t:0 "The Dealings with the Conservatives"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.1.d:0 "When the Great War came to an end on the Eastern Front, Finland was for a brief period a Monarchy, under the House of Hesse. However the following Civil War that saw the Reds and the Whites fight for control of the country, and with the defeat of Germany, the idea of a German Monarch on the throne of Finland was no longer a viable option. So, a Republic was established, and the ideas of a Kingdom of Finland was put away along with the Kaiser.\n\nHowever, times are changing and the current government doesn't have the backing from the people it should. By reaching out to conservative elements in the country, we should be able to strike a deal with them and gain their support."
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.1.a:0 "By limiting Crown Authority, we should be able to win them over."
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.1.b:0 "What's the King's job if not to rule?"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Proposes Political Union"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.2.d:0 "With the [FROM.GetNameDef] having crowned the Swedish Prince [FROM.GetLeader], they have now proposed a partnership between our two nations to help provide stability here in Northern Europe. The Union would see [FROM.GetNameDef] take on a more junior role, while maintaining its own Army, Navy and Airforce.\n\nWhile a political union between our two nations would definitely be beneifitial, it could also be seen as a powergrab by the [SOV.GetAdjective]s, and it could provoke them into action against us."
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.2.a:0 "We are stronger together"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.2.b:0 "A noble cause, but, alas, we shall not"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to the Union"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to our proposal, with this, we will be able to focus on our internal affairs more before our inevitable clash with the [SOV.GetAdjective]s."
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.3.a:0 "Terrific, together, we are stronger!"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Declines the Proposal"
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has, perhaps fortunately so, declined our proposal of a political union between our two states. This means that we can not count on the [SWE.GetAdjective]s should the [SOV.GetAdjective]s try and come for us once more."
 FIN_r56rp_monarchist.4.a:0 "We should still maintain good relations with them."
