This is where the assignments of graphics for planes, tanks and ships live.

Its a bit outdated, however Warlider took it upon himself to sort all graphics, so they are more period accurate since vanilla ai LOVES to
just not change the plane gfx.

Weight is just how high something apperas on the gfx list, mostly, but itll respect the que top to bottom if weights are the same.
