For whatever fucking reason, game loves to crash when a new graphic is added 
but sometimes on the second run itll load as it shoudl.

An added graphic will also display fine on the Projects screen, 
but clicking on said project will crash the game.
ENSURE IT DOESENT CRASH THE GAME WHEN YOU ARE ADDING NEW TEXTURES.
