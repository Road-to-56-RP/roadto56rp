# When you add modules remember to keep them from heaviest to lightest.
# in-code order of adding corresponds to how it appears in mod.

when merging, disregard research grouped by tags.

for example

category_all_infantry = {
	hard_attack = 0.25
}

That up there has the exact same effect, as slapping hard attack +25% on all infantry units separatley, however this way it will group the buffs per "unit"
and not separatley list all the bloody modifiers, making the tooltip a mess.
